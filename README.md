# Nov-GameJam
This project is for the November 2021 GameOff game jam.
The theme for the game jam is "bug"

This game is a "boss rush" aiming to have 3 bosses by its completion




## Project Blurb
The game world is created by a young man as they walk down the street. The things that he passes become the art canvas for his world, and thus is transformed into the environment. (Look at Kelps picture below to understand). The game character, FX and the such are in a drawn style, this is the kid using their imagination to impose their ideas onto the space that was created above. ^^
